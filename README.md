**Day 1 (02/08):** I am quite unsure about my coding abilities as I only started learning this past year. I am hoping to quickly improve my coding as well as get a good introduction to AI/ML since I have virtually no experience in those fields. By the time the makeathon starts I'm hoping to be a much better coder so that I am not a burden to the group! I am a bit worried about balancing my school work and extracurriculars on top of this but I will do my best to make it work.

# **Day 2 (02/09):**
*Question 1*: The difference between supervised and unsupervised learning is that Supervised ML programs are trained on a set of examples that are already defined whereas unsupervised ML programs must find patterns within a set of data

*Question 2* Scikit-Learn does not have the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries because Scikit Learn does not focus on the "loading, handling, manipulating, and visualising of data" so to deal with those steps Graphviz and other libraries are needed.

*Question 1*: Tensors are a representation of multidimension vector-like objects. That is, they are objects that have magnitude and multiple directions. They seem to be a large scale vector where tensors > vectors > scalars. They are used in Machine learning to encode mutlidimensional data such as images and pictures which often have 3+ fields of information that need to be known to process them. 

*Question 2:* I noticed that all the computations involved arrays. 

Overall, I struggled a bit with the material. Not only did it take a very long time, but I had difficulty troubleshooting the errors I was getting.

# **Day 4 (02/11):** 
The real-world problem that I am thinking about is mobility for the vision-impaired. The data set that I would start with is this natural images (https://www.kaggle.com/prasunroy/natural-images) data set that has images of various everyday object. I would probably utilize Convolutional Neural Networks as it involves fewer weights, which allows it to count fast and is less prone to overfitting. 

# **Day 5 (02/12):**
Today I was very confused because I felt like there was a massive disconnect between the material and the action item. I did the readings, but I still don't have a great grasp on Neural Networks let alone know how to create one for myself with no example. The articles that we are reading are certainly informative, but I feel like I am lacking any actual instruction so I put together what I could but I know that it is actually completely incorrect and will never work. I downloaded the chrome extension, but it isn't working–much like most of the action items that I have done this week unfortunately. I feel completely lost and I don't think I have really learned anything that I can apply to my code and when I look at some of my peers they seem to have a lot more background than I do. This is to be expected I suppose as I have 0 experience with AI but I feelt very defeated and unsure about the course of this training period. Here is my notebook, hopefully you can see it https://www.kaggle.com/kaylalee1116/notebook32cdc72033/edit

# **Day 8 (02/15):**
Today I had much better luck creating my first neural network. I'm still not entirely confident I understand the material well, but this will come with time I suppose!

# **Day 9 (02/16):**
*Question 1:* The game used my initial acceptances and rejects in the ML algorithm to automate my hiring process
*Question 2:* The Allegheny Family Screening Tool screened families to see if a child should be removed from an abusive household. This in theory is a good idea, but the data set used reflected societal prejudices relating to race and socioeconomic status. Nevertheless they do a good job of counteracting this bias by only using it as a advisory tool rather than an end all be all decider. I think a new and less biased data set should be used to make the algorithm less biased. I chose this model because I think it does a good job highlighting the potential harm that ML can inflict on us.

# **Day 10 (02/17):**
CNNs begin with convolution and pooling layers that break down the images and analyze them separately which then isi connected to a fully connected layer that take the output of the previous convlution and puuling layers and makes a prediction. Fully connected Neural networks–which are different from fully connect layers in CNNs–mirror a class NN in which every neuron is connected to every neuron in the subsequent later. CNNs are useful for computer vision whereas Fully connected neural networks would require an egregious number of connections given the complexity of images. Real world applications of CNNs take the form of tracking experiment progress. In CNNs the convolution layer is a filter that scans the image and creats a feature map. The pooling layer tends to downsize the sample and the fully connected layer lays out the infomation into a vector that can then be used for predictions

# **Day 15 (02/22):** 
I'm not sure where the responses for the other days went but these past few days i've been struggling to get my epochs to run quickly, meaning that my code is running for hours to run all of the epochs. More often than not it stops running...
