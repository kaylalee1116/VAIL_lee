**Day 1 (02/08):** I am quite unsure about my coding abilities as I only started learning this past year. I am hoping to quickly improve my coding as well as get a good introduction to AI/ML since I have virtually no experience in those fields. By the time the makeathon starts I'm hoping to be a much better coder so that I am not a burden to the group! I am a bit worried about balancing my school work and extracurriculars on top of this but I will do my best to make it work.

**Day 2 (02/08):**: 
*Question 1*: The difference between supervised and unsupervised learning is that Supervised ML programs are trained on a set of examples that are already defined whereas unsupervised ML programs must find patterns within a set of data
*Question 2* Scikit-Learn does not have the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries because Scikit Learn does not focus on the "loading, handling, manipulating, and visualising of data" so to deal with those steps Graphviz and other libraries are needed.
