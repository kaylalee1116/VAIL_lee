**Day 1 (02/08):** I am quite unsure about my coding abilities as I only started learning this past year. I am hoping to quickly improve my coding as well as get a good introduction to AI/ML since I have virtually no experience in those fields. By the time the makeathon starts I'm hoping to be a much better coder so that I am not a burden to the group! I am a bit worried about balancing my school work and extracurriculars on top of this but I will do my best to make it work.

*Question 1*: The difference between supervised and unsupervised learning is that Supervised ML programs are trained on a set of examples that are already defined whereas unsupervised ML programs must find patterns within a set of data

*Question 2* Scikit-Learn does not have the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries because Scikit Learn does not focus on the "loading, handling, manipulating, and visualising of data" so to deal with those steps Graphviz and other libraries are needed.

*Question 1*: Tensors are a representation of multidimension vector-like objects. That is, they are objects that have magnitude and multiple directions. They seem to be a large scale vector where tensors > vectors > scalars. They are used in Machine learning to encode mutlidimensional data such as images and pictures which often have 3+ fields of information that need to be known to process them. 

*Question 2:* I noticed that all the computations involved arrays. 

Overall, I struggled a bit with the material. Not only did it take a very long time, but I had difficulty troubleshooting the errors I was getting.

The real-world problem that I am thinking about is mobility for the vision-impaired. The data set that I would start with is this natural images (https://www.kaggle.com/prasunroy/natural-images) data set that has images of various everyday object. I would probably utilize Convolutional Neural Networks as it involves fewer weights, which allows it to count fast and is less prone to overfitting.
